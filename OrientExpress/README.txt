This project is an android application which can be directly deployed as an apk file on a android mobile.
You will require a local database and this can run on local networks over wifi. I have used IBM db2 in this application.
This project was done on ecplise using the dojo plugin and the sdk tools

It is basically used as a tool to fasten up the joining process for employees. The functionalities include
a) Employee Documents submission
b) Find the exact location on maps as to where he will find his manager precisely to which building and which floor and desk number
c) Contact details of his manager
d) Team chat
e) Same Department employees and a few other functionalities.
